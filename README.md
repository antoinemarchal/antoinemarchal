## @amarchal -- Astrophysicist & radio astronomer

Iâ€™m based @LPENS (Paris).

- ðŸ›« Before that I was a Fellow @CITA in Canada and then @RSAA/ANU in Australia. 

Projects: 
- Right now Iâ€™m building IViS ðŸŒ±, a GPU-accelerated, energy-efficient imager for scalable mosaicking of large hyperspectral cubes from ASKAP and MeerKAT.
- I am a member of the GASKAP-HI collaboration.

## @amarchal -- Atrophysicist & radio astronomer

Welcome to my GitHub page. I am based @LPENS in Paris and I enjoy working on the understanding the structure of the ISM and its link to star formation. 
These days I am developping an energy-efficient GPU accelerated imager (IViS) that supports mosaicking scalable for large hyper-spcetral cubes from ASKAP and MeerKAT.

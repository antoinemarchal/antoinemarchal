## @amarchal -- Atrophysicist & radio astronomer

Hi, I’m based at LPENS (Paris). I work on the structure of the interstellar medium (ISM) and its role in star formation.

Right now I’m building IViS, a GPU-accelerated, energy-efficient imager for scalable mosaicking of large hyperspectral cubes from ASKAP and MeerKAT.
